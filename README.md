# SQL_Rockbuster_Stealth
As part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Program, this [project](Rockbuster%20-%20Data%20Project%20Brief%20.pdf) is aimed to demonstrate the knowledge of SQL to answer business questions. 

## Background

Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Objective

## Business Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
